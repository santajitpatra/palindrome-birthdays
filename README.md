# Palindrome Birthday Web App

This is a simple web app that helps you find out if your birthday is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

## Features

- Enter your birthdate and check if it's a palindrome
- Supports multiple date formats (YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY)
- Accounts for leap years
- If your birthdate is not a palindrome, the app tells you the nearest palindrome date and how many days you missed it by

## How to Use
